Hello and welcome to my site! My name is Rachel and I'm a rising senior at Harvard College, studying African Studies and Global Health. While I have virtually no experience with coding, I am looking forward to meeting you all, learning lots, and taking Cape Town by storm this summer! 
</p>
<p>In this day and age, I believe it is increasingly necessary for everyone, regardless of their academic pursuits, to understand web technologies. While I have never really taken any CS courses, I've always been really interested in design and social media as a means of evaluating how technology can be used in both medical and educational settings to reach a wider audience. Ultimately I am taking this course as a means of gaining the skills to implement new online health care management systems which could help health professionals better understand the backgrounds and belief-systems of the patients and populations they are serving.</p>
<p>In general I consider myself a very adventurous person and have spent a great deal of my time abroad meandering through often unknown alleyways. I love exploring new places by foot and hope to really take in the local food and music scene while I'm in Cape Town. I also love wandering around markets so I'm hoping to add to my collection of foreign trinkets as well. 
</p>

I absolutely love to travel and thus have picked up an undying love of spicy food. Sometimes I carry a small bottle of Scriracha in my bag, and when I studied abroad in Paris (last fall) I went through multiple bottles of hot sauce. I'm super spontaneous and absolutely love music, art and photography - so I'm basically always up for an adventure.
